# DTSA-5503-Final-Project
Repo containing final project for DTSA-5503: Fundamentals of Data Visualization. 

In this project I used dash in Jupyter Notebook to create a user friendly application that guides the viewer through the classic Wine data sets. This was my first experience with plotly and dash, and I am eager to continue making visualizations using these tools. The dataset lives in the repo as "WineData.csv", and the project itself is "WineVisualizationProject.ipynb". Enjoy!
